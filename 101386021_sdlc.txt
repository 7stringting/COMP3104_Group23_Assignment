DevOps fosters collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.
Teams work together to ensure that code is developed, tested, and deployed smoothly, reducing silos and enhancing communication.
DevOps includes monitoring and feedback mechanisms to track application performance and user behavior.
Teams can quickly identify issues, gather user feedback, and make data-driven improvements.
